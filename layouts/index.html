    <p class="text-lead">I'm Wherd, a full-stack developer who's all about turning cool ideas into reality with lines of code.
        Beyond coding, I'm a big fan of TV shows that keep me glued to the screen, and music that sets the mood for my creative sessions.
        But what really gets my geek on is game development - I'm all about crafting interactive experiences that are seriously fun.
        Whether you're a fellow coder, a binge-watcher, a music enthusiast, or just someone looking for a bit of creative inspiration,
        I'm stoked to have you along for the ride. Let's dive into this awesome journey together!</p>
